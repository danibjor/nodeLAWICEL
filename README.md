# CANbus - Controller Area Network in Javascript

CANbus is a module for working with Controller Area Network (CAN) networks from
Javascript.

CANbus implements communication with the bus, and common protocols that are used
on CAN. These are most often seen in automotive in-vehicle networks. 

Currently, CANbus supports the LAWICEL protocol, which maps CAN to serial.
